Never give up,
Those who try,
Never fail.

When the world whispered,
"You're too much,"
She smiled and said,
"I was never here to be little."

**********

Doubt kills more dreams
Than failure ever will.
So walk tall—
Even when you trip.

**********

It's okay to cry
you are not weak-
you are just self-aware

**********

Fall seven times,
Stand up eight.
Cry, crash, reboot—
But never stay down.

**********

You are not behind.
You're becoming.
The bloom comes
**after the burn**.

**********
